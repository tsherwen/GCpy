# GCHPy

A comprehensive python tool for the GEOS-Chem High-Performance (GCHP), 
with the focus on: <br />

1) Cube-Sphere<->Lat-Lon conservative regridding without external grid description files. (Make use of the Tempest regridding package) <br />
2) Direct visualization of data on the cube-sphere grid. <br />
3) Benchmark suite for comparing GCHP and GEOSChem-classic. <br />

Tutorials (with sample data) should be on a separate repo to make the size of the core routines small. <br />

### Environment setup:
$export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/GCHPy/:$PYTHONPATH
(say you clone to the home directory)
