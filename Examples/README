GCPy Examples

The Examples directory contains scripts that illustrate ways to use GCPy. 
This directory currently includes a random mix of scripts developed by GCPy 
users for personal use. These scripts may be adapted for your own use or may be 
helpful in learning python. Be aware that there is currently no adopted 
python style guide used in these examples and assumed programming proficiency 
level will vary. 

GCPy is still in the beginning phases of planning and development. As GCPy
evolves, we will put in place a more structured set of tutorials and examples.
If you would like to share your code, or would like to contribute to the
development of GCPy, please contact the GEOS-Chem Support Team.
